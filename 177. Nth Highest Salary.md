+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

> For example, given the above Employee table, the nth highest salary where n = 2 is 200. If there is no nth highest salary, then the query should return null.

     SELECT IF(COUNT(*)<N,null,MIN(s.Salary))
     FROM
     (SELECT DISTINCT Salary
      FROM Employee
      ORDER BY Salary DESC
      LIMIT 0,N) s
  );
