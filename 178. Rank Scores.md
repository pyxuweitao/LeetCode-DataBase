# 178. Rank Scores

## Question

> Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.

```mysql
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```

> For example, given the above Scores table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):

```mysql
+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```

## Answer

```mysql
# 1426ms over 12.30%
SELECT a.Score,
( SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Score)
  FROM Scores
  WHERE Score > a.Score ) + 1 rank
FROM Scores a
ORDER BY Score  DESC
```

---------------------

```mysql
# 932ms over 58.26%
SELECT a.Score Score,(
       SELECT COUNT(*) + 1
       FROM (
           SELECT DISTINCT Score
           FROM Scores ) b
       WHERE a.Score < b.Score) Rank
FROM Scores a ORDER BY Score DESC;
```
