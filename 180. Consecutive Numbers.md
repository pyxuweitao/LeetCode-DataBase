```mysql

> For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

## Answer

```mysql
#1668 ms over 39.77%
SELECT DISTINCT Num
FROM Logs a JOIN
( SELECT b.Id, b.Num bNum, c.Num cNum
  FROM Logs b JOIN Logs c
  ON b.Id + 1 = c.Id  ) d
ON d.Id - 1 = a.Id
WHERE a.Num = bNum AND bNum = cNum
```

-----------------------

```mysql
#1622 ms over 54.78%
SELECT DISTINCT a.Num
FROM Logs a
    JOIN Logs b ON a.Id - 1 = b.Id
    JOIN Logs c ON a.Id + 1 = c.Id
WHERE a.Num = b.Num AND b.Num = c.Num
```
